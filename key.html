                DEAR ADMINS, PLEASE NOTE THAT FOR ENCRYPTING THE NEWS ARTICLES, WE WILL BE USING AN AES KEY. WE WILL BE USING A SUBSTITUTION CIPHER ON THIS TEXT, AND THE FREQUENCY ANALYSIS RESULTS THAT YOU GET WILL BE RELATED TO THE AES KEY. HOW? WELL JUST TAKE THE FIRST 32 UNIQUE CHARACTERS DESCENDING IN FREQUENCY AND THAT'S THE AES KEY IN BYTES. IF ANY OF THEM HAVE THE SAME FREQUENCY THEN FIRST USE THE CHARACTER THAT APPEARS FIRST IN UTF8, THEN THE NEXT OTHER CHARACTERS. TREAT ALL CHARACTERS AND THE KEY WILL BE ALL UPPERCASE! WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? THIS IS BECAUSE OUR ARTICLES KEEP GETTING LEAKED! SO WE ARE GONNA TRY A DIFFERENT WAY THIS TIME ROUND. HEY I BARELY PASSED THE CYBERSECURITY MODULE BUT I CAN STILL MAKE USE OF IT! HOPEFULLY THIS WEBSITE STILL STAYS SECURE AND ONLY OUR SUBSCRIBERS CAN SEE IT! #SUBSTITUTIONCIPHER #2023LIFE #2023ISGREATMAN
